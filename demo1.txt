DevOps (a clipped compound of "development" and "operations") 
is a software development methodology 
that combines software development (Dev) 
with information technology operations (Ops). 
The goal of DevOps is to shorten the 
systems development life cycle while 
also delivering features, 
fixes, and updates frequently in close 
alignment with business objectives. 
The DevOps approach 
is to include automation and event 
monitoring at all steps of the software build.
